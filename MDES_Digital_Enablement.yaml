  title: MDES for Merchants
  description: | 
    The MDES APIs are designed as RPC style stateless web services where each API endpoint represents an operation to be performed.  All request and response payloads are sent in the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data-interchange format. Each endpoint in the API specifies the HTTP Method used to access it. All strings in request and response objects are to be UTF-8 encoded.  Each API URI includes the major and minor version of API that it conforms to.  This will allow multiple concurrent versions of the API to be deployed simultaneously.

      summary: Used to digitize a card to create a server-based Token.
      description: | 
       Used to digitize a card to create a server-based Token. MDES will perform both card availability and eligibility checks to check that this specific card is eligible for digitization. As both availability and eligibility are combined, only a Tokenization Authorization message is sent to the issuer as part of this request to authorize the digitization. No Tokenization Eligibility message is sent. The digitization decision will be one of Approved or Declined.

      summary: Used to retrieve static Assets from MDES�s repository, such as Card art, MasterCard brand logos, Issuer logos, and Terms and Conditions.
      description: | 
       This API is used to retrieve static Assets from MDES�s repository, such as - Card art, MasterCard brand logos, Issuers� logos, and Terms and Conditions. Every Asset in the repository is referenced using an Asset ID. Once an Asset has been assigned to an Asset ID, the contents of the Asset will not change. If contents do need to change (for example, Issuer has supplied new artwork for a product), they will be updated in the repository and be assigned a new Asset ID.  Different types of Assets are supported in the repository, such as images and text files; and for each type of Asset, multiple formats may be supported. For example, a single image Asset may be supported in various file formats; or variant sizes, allowing the Token Requestor to select the most appropriate format to use for a particular target device.

      description: | 
       This API is used by MDES to notify the Token Requestor of significant Token updates. Typical notification scenarios include  <br> <br>
       
       1. Informing the merchant a token is active
       2. Informing the merchant a token has been suspended by the Issuer
       3. Informing the merchant a token has been unsuspended by the Issuer
       4. Informing the merchant a token has been deleted by the Issuer
       5. Informing the merchant of a product configuration change (such as a change in Card Art)
       6. Informing the merchant of underlying changes to the FPAN metadata associated to the token<br>
        
       __Connection Security__<br>
       Mastercard will connect via TLS protocol and verify the server certificate before establishing a connection to the client endpoint. During this handshake, the client server can request TLS client authentication. Mastercard will present a client certificate which identifies as �ws.mastercard.com� This client certificate is issued by the Entrust L1K certificate and should be available in most trust stores.
        <br><br>
       __Conditional Objects__<br>
       The contents of the notifyTokenUpdated API will vary depending which of the above scneraios triggered the notification. <br>
        
       1. *productConfig* - Provided when Product Configuration has changed (e.g. such as card art).     
       2. *tokenInfo* - Provided when either the details of the token or associated FPAN have changed (such as token or PAN expiry).  
        
        The optional objects will always contain a minimum set of data which be returned regardless of whether or not updates have been made. These fields are denoted as required fields.<br>
